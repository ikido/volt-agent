  - `--output-dir`
- ✅ Real-time progress display using Rich
- ✅ `pipeline list-runs` command with status filtering
- ✅ `pipeline show-run` command for run details
- ✅ `pipeline cancel-run` command for cancelling workflows
- ✅ `pipeline temporal-ui` command to open browser

#### 13. Configuration Management

- ✅ Map entity types to enrichment activities
- ✅ Concurrency limits per entity type
- ✅ Default fallback configuration

#### 14. Documentation
- ✅ Complete PRD (PRD_Pipeline_Based_Architecture.md)
- ✅ Implementation status tracking (this file)
- ✅ Comprehensive setup guide (SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ Feature README with quick start (README.md)
- ✅ Architecture diagrams and data flow

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Fibery Activities** (Activities 5-6)

2. **Implement Entity Enrichment Activities**
   - Type-specific enrichment functions
   - Fibery API integration for fetching entity details

3. **Implement Reporting Activities** (Activities 7-9)
   - LLM integration for report generation
   - Person and team report creation

4. **Create Temporal Workflow**
   - Complete workflow orchestration
   - Progress tracking implementation
   - Error handling

5. **Build CLI Interface**

   - Temporal client integration

6. **Testing**
   - Start Temporal locally with Docker Compose
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Validate all activities work correctly

## Key Design Decisions

1. **JSON over SQLite**: Simplifies debugging and manual inspection
2. **Temporal over custom orchestration**: Built-in reliability and observability
3. **Rolling window pattern**: Bounded concurrency prevents API rate limit issues
4. **Per-entity-type enrichment**: Extensible design for different entity schemas
5. **Cleanup activities**: Ensures idempotent stage re-runs
6. **LLM report generation**: All reports generated via LLM for consistency
