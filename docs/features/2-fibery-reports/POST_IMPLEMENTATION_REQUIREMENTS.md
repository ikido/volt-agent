## Overview

This document tracks improvements, issues, and enhancements discovered after the initial Fibery Entity Context Integration implementation (v1.0).

---

## 🐛 Issues (All Resolved)

### 1. Verbose Summaries for Entities with Missing Data

**Status:** 🟢 Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Reported:** 2025-10-08  
**Resolved:** 2025-10-08 - Afternoon  
**Testing:** Validated with alex.akilin@wearevolt.com

**Problem:**
When entities lack descriptions or comments, AI-generated summaries are verbose and not useful. They attempt to provide context where none exists.

**Expected Behavior:**
- If description is missing: Show "No description"
- If comments are missing: Show "No comments"
- Flag this as an issue that needs attention
- Show only essential info: status, start date, ETA
- **Flag if ETA is in the past** (overdue items)

**Example Current Output:**
```markdown
### #7658: Some Task
**Time:** 17.7 hours | **Type:** Scrum/Task

[Long verbose AI summary trying to explain something with no data]

**Status:** In Progress
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
### #7658: Some Task
**Time:** 17.7 hours | **Type:** Scrum/Task

⚠️ **Missing Context**: No description, no comments

**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** 2025-09-29  
**ETA:** 2025-09-23 ⚠️ **OVERDUE** (15 days past due)

**Context:**
- Part of Feature #1575: [Feature name]
```

**Solution:**
- Update prompt templates to handle missing data gracefully
- Add conditional logic to flag missing context
- Calculate and flag overdue items
- Keep summary minimal when data is sparse

### 2. Missing Per-Run Subfolder Structure

**Status:** 🟢 Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Reported:** 2025-10-08  
**Resolved:** 2025-10-08 - Afternoon  
**Testing:** Validated - proper folder structure created

**Problem:**
Reports are being written directly to `./tmp/` instead of creating per-run subfolders as documented in the PRD.

**Expected Structure:**
```
./tmp/run_{timestamp}/
├── toggl_data/
│   ├── user1@example.com/
│   │   ├── 01_raw_toggl_report.md
│   │   ├── 02_entity_7658_raw.json
│   │   ├── 03_entity_7658_summary.md
│   │   └── 06_enriched_report.md
│   └── user2@example.com/
│       └── ...
├── fibery_analysis/
│   └── ...
├── combined_individual_reports.md
└── team_summary.md
```

**Current Structure:**
```
./tmp/
├── toggl_individual_reports_2025-10-08-12-40.md
└── toggl_team_summary_2025-10-08-12-40.md
```

**Solution:**
- Update `ReportGenerator` to create run-specific subfolders
- Create user subfolders for enriched entity data
- Save intermediate files (raw JSON, individual summaries)
- Update file references in reports

**References:**
- PRD Section 4.3: [Entity Enrichment Pipeline](PRD_Core.md#431-directory-structure)
- PRD Report Formats: [Intermediate Files Structure](PRD_Report_Formats.md#5-intermediate-files-structure)

## 🚀 Enhancement Requests

### 3. Show Parent Feature Context for Tasks

**Status:** 🟢 Resolved (Exceeded Expectations!)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reported:** 2025-10-08  
**Resolved:** 2025-10-08 - Afternoon  
**Testing:** Validated with run_2025-10-08-13-05

**Implementation:**
Created a comprehensive **Feature Summary** section in reports that includes:
- ✅ Aggregated time spent per feature
- ✅ AI-generated feature overview (from description/comments)
- ✅ Progress tracking (completed/total tasks)
- ✅ Overdue task counts with ⚠️ flags
- ✅ Timeline information (planned/actual release dates)
- ✅ Complete task breakdown with status icons (🔲/✅)
- ✅ Per-task overdue flags
- ✅ Feature overdue detection

**Components Added:**
- `EnrichmentPipeline.enrich_features_from_tasks()` - Fetches and aggregates features
- Feature section in `ReportGenerator.generate_individual_report()`  
- Feature-level statistics calculation
- Fixed camelCase/snake_case field name handling

---

### 4. Nested Relationship Support

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Core.md - Nested Relationships](PRD_Core.md#nested-relationship-handling)

**Description:**
Implement multi-level relationship fetching for entities like:
- Sub-task → Task → Feature (3 levels)
- Sub-bug → Bug → Feature (3 levels)
- Work Version → Design Feature → Scrum Feature (3 levels)

This was documented in PRD but not implemented in v1.0.

**Example:**
```markdown
### #9234: Update user authentication logic
**Type:** Sub-task

**Context Chain:**
- Sub-task of Task #7658: Implement user management system
- Part of Feature #1575: User Authentication & Authorization
- Strategic Goal: Complete authentication overhaul for Q4 2025
```

## 🔮 Future Features (From PRD, Not Implemented)

### 5. Work Alignment Analysis

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Core.md - Work Alignment Analysis](PRD_Core.md#45-work-alignment-analysis)

**Description:**
Compare Toggl entries with Fibery entity states to detect:
- ✅ Properly tracked: Time logged AND Fibery state matches
- ⚠️ Fibery not updated: Time logged BUT Fibery state is stale
- ❓ Missing in Toggl: Entity assigned BUT no time logged
- 📋 Open: Entity assigned BUT not started yet

**CLI Flag:** `--fibery-analysis` (placeholder exists)

---

### 6. Unknown Entity Type Detection

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Schema_Management.md - Unknown Entity Type Handling](PRD_Schema_Management.md#2-unknown-entity-type-handling)

**Description:**
Generate markdown reports showing entity types not in configuration:
- Impact analysis (hours logged, users affected)
- Priority scoring
- Recommended configuration snippets
- Sample entity data

**Output:** `unknown_entities_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

### 7. Schema Validation Reports

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Schema_Management.md - Configuration Validation](PRD_Schema_Management.md#4-configuration-validation)

**Description:**
Validate configuration against live Fibery schema:
- Detect field changes
- Find missing fields
- Identify deprecated fields
- Configuration health report

**Output:** `config_validation_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

### 8. Enhanced Team Summary with Project Grouping

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low

**Description:**
Group entities by feature/project in team summary:
- Show progress across initiatives
- Team-level patterns
- Major focus areas
- Cross-team collaboration

---

## 📝 Configuration Improvements

### 9. Add More Entity Types

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** As needed

**Entity Types to Consider:**
- Scrum/Epic
- Scrum/Sprint
- Scrum/Release
- Scrum/Hotfix
- Design/Design Feature
- Design/Work Version
- Product Management/User Request

**Process:**
1. Discover entity structure in Fibery GraphQL
2. Add configuration to `config.yaml`
3. Create prompt template in `config/prompts/`
4. Test with actual data

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### 11. Batch Entity Fetching

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** Low

**Description:**
Current implementation fetches entities one-by-one. Could optimize with:
- Batch GraphQL queries (multiple entities in one request)
- Parallel fetching with connection pooling
- Smart caching strategies

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce enrichment time from 3 minutes to <1 minute for 50 entities
