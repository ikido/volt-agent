## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 1. Nested Relationship Support

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Core.md - Nested Relationships](PRD_Core.md#nested-relationship-handling)

**Description:**
Implement multi-level relationship fetching for entities like:
- Sub-task → Task → Feature (3 levels)
- Sub-bug → Bug → Feature (3 levels)
- Work Version → Design Feature → Scrum Feature (3 levels)

This was documented in PRD but not implemented in v1.0.

**Example:**
```markdown
### #9234: Update user authentication logic
**Type:** Sub-task

**Context Chain:**
- Sub-task of Task #7658: Implement user management system
- Part of Feature #1575: User Authentication & Authorization
- Strategic Goal: Complete authentication overhaul for Q4 2025
```

### 2. Work Alignment Analysis

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Core.md - Work Alignment Analysis](PRD_Core.md#45-work-alignment-analysis)

**Description:**
Compare Toggl entries with Fibery entity states to detect:
- ✅ Properly tracked: Time logged AND Fibery state matches
- ⚠️ Fibery not updated: Time logged BUT Fibery state is stale
- ❓ Missing in Toggl: Entity assigned BUT no time logged
- 📋 Open: Entity assigned BUT not started yet

**CLI Flag:** `--fibery-analysis` (placeholder exists)

---

### 3. Unknown Entity Type Detection

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Schema_Management.md - Unknown Entity Type Handling](PRD_Schema_Management.md#2-unknown-entity-type-handling)

**Description:**
Generate markdown reports showing entity types not in configuration:
- Impact analysis (hours logged, users affected)
- Priority scoring
- Recommended configuration snippets
- Sample entity data

**Output:** `unknown_entities_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

### 4. Schema Validation Reports

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low  
**Related PRD:** [PRD_Schema_Management.md - Configuration Validation](PRD_Schema_Management.md#4-configuration-validation)

**Description:**
Validate configuration against live Fibery schema:
- Detect field changes
- Find missing fields
- Identify deprecated fields
- Configuration health report

**Output:** `config_validation_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

### 5. Enhanced Team Summary with Project Grouping

**Status:** 📋 Future  
**Priority:** Low

**Description:**
Group entities by feature/project in team summary:
- Show progress across initiatives
- Team-level patterns
- Major focus areas
- Cross-team collaboration

---

## 📝 Configuration Improvements

### 6. Add More Entity Types

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** As needed

**Entity Types to Consider:**
- Scrum/Epic
- Scrum/Sprint
- Scrum/Release
- Scrum/Hotfix
- Design/Design Feature
- Design/Work Version
- Product Management/User Request

**Process:**
1. Discover entity structure in Fibery GraphQL
2. Add configuration to `config.yaml`
3. Create prompt template in `config/prompts/`
4. Test with actual data

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### 7. Batch Entity Fetching

**Status:** 📋 Backlog  
**Priority:** Low

**Description:**
Current implementation fetches entities one-by-one. Could optimize with:
- Batch GraphQL queries (multiple entities in one request)
- Parallel fetching with connection pooling
- Smart caching strategies

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce enrichment time from 3 minutes to <1 minute for 50 entities

## 📋 Status Indicators

- 📋 Backlog - Planned for future
- 🔮 Future - Nice-to-have features

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Significant impact on functionality
- **Medium**: Improves user experience
- **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancement
