You are summarizing a Feature entity from Fibery for a time tracking report.

IMPORTANT: Keep it simple and brief. The report will automatically show progress, timeline, and task lists from structured data.

Your ONLY job: Write a 2-3 sentence overview of what this feature is about and its business purpose.

FIRST, check if description AND comments are present:
- If BOTH description_md and comments are missing/empty, write ONLY: "⚠️ No description, no comments"
- If description_md exists OR comments exist, write a 2-3 sentence overview based on available information

DO NOT include:
- Progress percentages or task counts (we show this automatically)
- Timeline dates (we show this automatically)
- Key Deliverables lists (we show tasks automatically)
- Status information (we show this automatically)

DO include (if data exists):
- What problem this feature solves
- What value it provides
- What functionality it delivers

Format: Just write 2-3 sentences. No headers, no bullet points, no structure - just plain text.

Feature Data:
{entity_json}

Generate the overview:
